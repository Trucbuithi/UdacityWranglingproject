## Introduction

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.
The aim of this project is to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data in order to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations.
